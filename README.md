# Small Game Clones
These are subset of games from various tutorials (see README's for more details) to further my understanding of game design. Most of these games are meant to be function as closely as possible to the original games but not take credit for the originals, therefore all notable differences will be noted in the documentation. Information regarding the source of the code is recorded in the README for each game.

### Organization
Each game is designed a little differently from one another. These games are meant to push my use of C++ best practices and tap into various methods of game design. Every game's README has a section named "Modifications" where I note what changes I have made to the tutorial's design, as well as the reasoning behind my choices. Any game that is sufficiently different from the original will be kept in a separate respository outside of this one.

### Dependencies
All these games use SFML [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) as a window system to manage events and render graphics.

### C++ Standard
These games implement features from the C++17 standard.
