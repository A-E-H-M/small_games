# Small Game Clones
These are subset of games from various tutorials (see README's for more details) to further my understanding of game design. Most of these games are meant to be clones, therefore all notable differences will be noted in the documentation.

### Organization
Each game is designed a little differently then one another. These games are meant practice implementation of design. Any game that is sufficiently different from the original will be kept in a separate respository outside of this one.

### Dependencies
All these games use SFML [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) as a window system to manage events and render graphics.

### C++ Standard
These games implement features from the C++17 standard.
