# Timber Oye
Timber Oye is meant to replicate the Timber arcade game from Bally Midway. This introductory game focuses on getting familiar with the SFML library and basic game elements like sprites, textures, and game loops.

### Organization
This project is based on the 1st game exercise in [Beginning C++ Game Programming: Learn C++ from scratch by building fun games](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/search?query=Beginning%20C%2B%2B%20Game%20Programming) (Third Edition) by John Horton. Modifications I've made to the game are noted in the 'Modifications' below, along with a short description of the reasoning for the modification.

### Dependencies
Timber Oye use SFML [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) as a window system to manage events and render graphics.

### C++ Standard
Timber Oye implement features from the C++17 standard.

## Modifications
#### This section will continue to be updated.
