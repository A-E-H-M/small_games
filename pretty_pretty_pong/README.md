# Pretty Pretty Pong
Pretty Pretty Pong is meant to replicate the 1972 breakout game Pong from Atari. The focus of this project is to reinforce OOP concepts, such as, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

### Organization
This project is based on the 2nd game exercise in [Beginning C++ Game Programming: Learn C++ from scratch by building fun games](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/search?query=Beginning%20C%2B%2B%20Game%20Programming) (Third Edition) by John Horton. Modifications I've made to the game are noted in the 'Modifications' below, along with a short description of the reasoning for the modification.

### Dependencies
Pretty Pretty Pong use SFML [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) as a window system to manage events and render graphics.

### C++ Standard
Pretty Pretty Pong implement features from the C++17 standard.

## Modifications
